      <p>Hello everyone, my name is Charlie Erling and I am currently enrolled in the University of Arizona's Coding Boot Camp. I am currently learning HTML, CSS, and Bootsrap, and will become versed in full-stack coding in early 2019.</p>

      <p>I am a big sports fan, and hope to put the skills I learn to use somewhere in the sports world. I currently host a Phoenix Suns podcast, the Sunny in PHX Podcast, and sell sports memorabilia. Learning how to code will directly help those two hobbies of mine.</p>

      <p>This is the first website that I have built from scratch. Please enjoy looking around and check back frequently to see what I add to the portfolio. Thanks!</p>
